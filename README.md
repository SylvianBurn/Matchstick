# Matchstick
First year project from CPE module.

Description:

We had to create a program that plays matchstick against you.
You simply had to give the line on which you wanted to remove matches then the number of matches to remove.
Then an AI plays and the person that removed the last match lost.

Usage:
make to compile the project
./matchstick nb_lines matches to launch
nb_lines is the number of lines of the playing grid
matches is the maximum number of matches that can be removed per player per round
